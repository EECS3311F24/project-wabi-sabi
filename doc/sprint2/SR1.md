# Sprint 1 retrospective
**Date:** November 5th, 7 pm

**Participants:**
Amanuel Aknaw, Jayden Brooks, Fred Hong, Jarod Lustre, Kimia Rajaeifar

All points mentioned in this document is based on discussions among the entire team. All members of the team contributed to the meeting and decision-making process.

## Meeting documentation:

### Good Practices that we should continue:
-	As a team we believe that our communication in sprint 1 was excellent and we are hoping to maintain this level of effective communication in the second and third sprint as well, as it makes discussions about the tasks that we must do much easier. We communicate any issue that we are facing on discord and if needed we bring it up in meetings.
-	We also believe that having meetings consistently allows the team to see the progress and allows us to point out any issues early in the process. We did try to have consistent meetings in sprint 1 to see each team member’s work and provide updates and have standups. We aim to continue this practice moving forwards.
-	The team was also happy with the organization of tasks through Trello tickets and how we broke them down. This approach allowed each person to know exactly what task they needed to work on for sprint. The tasks were distributed based on the availability of team members and their abilities. This allowed for learning and growth while not pressuring the team to work on tasks that are too out of their comfort zone. Since each member was aware of their ability, they were able to focus on a task and deliver excellent results. We plan to continue this approach in upcoming sprints.
-	Our documentation practices proved to be effective in sprint1. In our backend the addition of Blueprints made our backend much easier to use. In the same manner Swagger made our backend APIs more understandable as it allowed us to test the endpoint. We aim to continue these practices.

### New practices:
-	One practice that we should bring in is submitting the pull requests (PRs) earlier, even before we are fully done implementing the task so that in case of bugs, it can be checked by the other team members more easily.
-	In the upcoming sprints we should test our code locally as thoroughly as possible by considering all the cases and at least trying out the basic functionalities before submitting a pull request.
-	For the backend, we proposed separating routes by HTTP headers rather than just the URL. This change could be an addition to our backend that would make the requests cleaner and easier to manage and debug, which we are hoping to add in Sprint 2.

### Bad/harmful Practices:
-	We had some instances of pushing to main branch without making a PR or merging our own PRs to main without having other team members review them. Moving forward we would really want to avoid this as it could cause issues if there is something in the code that is not at least checked once by another team member. This also makes it harder to track the progress and leaves the team members in the dark as they are not aware of the changes that were made, and it could introduce bugs. Moving on we will make sure to have PRs for each task and have at least one team member review them before merging it with main.
-	Another harmful practice was the occasional failure to pull from main branch before branching off main branch. This issue causes extra work when we need to merge the changes as outdated branches can lead to merge conflict which will be challenging to resolve. Moving forward the team will make sure to ensure we have the latest changes whenever we are creating a new branch.
-	We had some issues with forgetting to install any dependencies and not properly installing the libraries that we need for this project. However, we believe by the end of the first sprint we fully got used to all the tasks we need to do to make sure all requirements are fully installed, and we were able to debug any issues that came up. Moving forwards, we will continue to be aware of any dependencies.

### Best experience in sprint1:
-	As a team we all agree that the best and most rewarding experience we had this sprint was being able to connect all aspects of our features together and seeing an app that used to be just an idea come to life. We are extremely happy about the features that we were able to add in sprint 1 and we hope to be able to add interesting and new features each sprint.
-	We are thrilled that we were able to push the limits of our comfort zone and were each able to try working on new features that allowed for continuous learning of new technologies. As a team we are hoping to continue learning and working on more complex features as we continue.
-	As team Wabi Sabi, we are so happy to have a team that cares so much about our project and we can see each member’s hard work to deliver high quality results, considering the time constraints and the other courses commitments. We are so glad to have such a great team, and we hope to keep our great team dynamic.
-	Each one of us is so proud of the contributions we were able to make to our project in sprint 1 and we hope to continue improving our project.

### Worst experience in sprint 1:

-	For the most challenging experience this sprint, the team unanimously mentioned resolving merge conflicts, which corresponds to the bad practices mentioned earlier. We are taking the steps mentioned above to make sure we do not continue having these issues in the remaining sprints.
-	As a team we did have a hard time with the volume of documentation that we required for this sprint, but we understand that it is a requirement and that for each sprint we will need to build on top of it. The first sprint was especially difficult in terms of documentation because we were making everything from scratch. However, in next sprints we will build on top of what we have, which should make it easier to manage.
-	For some of the team members with less experience using the tech stack that we are using, there were a lot of setup issues and installation problems which slowed them down. Thankfully we were able to fix the issues as a team with the help of more experienced team members, but we are hoping to not have as many of these issues moving forwards.
-	For the team members with less experience with our tech stack, there was a learning curve which took significant effort. This might have added more pressure on the members with more experience. However, thankfully our team members are more comfortable with the tech stack for sprint 2 and beyond.
