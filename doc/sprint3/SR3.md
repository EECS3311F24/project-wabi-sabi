# Sprint 3 retrospective
**Date:** November 30th, 7pm

**Participants:**
Amanuel Aknaw, Jayden Brooks, Fred Hong, Jarod Lustre, Kimia Rajaeifar

All points mentioned in this document is based on discussions among the entire team. All members of the team contributed to the meeting and decision-making process.

## Meeting documentation:

### Good Practices that we should continue:
-	One of the practices that we should continue no matter what is keeping our constant flow of communication. We are glad that we were able to keep this communication style going for the past sprints and we hope to be able to continue doing so if we decide to continue working on this project as a team.
-	Our team believes that having efficient meetings to solve issues and give updates is a practice that helped a lot in this release, and we believe that if we were to continue to have another release, we should keep this practice.
-	We believe that properly distributing tasks and using available technologies to enhance this task, was one of the practices that allowed us to have a smooth release. If we were to have more releases we would continue doing so.



### New practices:
-	This release we did not have the capability to figure out the CSS style we had in mind for the timer. If we were to have another release our team would love to work on that feature so that the style of the application looks more interesting and aligns with our initial plans.
-	We did not focus on having test cases this release. However, if we were to have another release, it would be helpful to have test cases to ensure our application works consistently. We believe this would be a valuable addition to our product and it would make debugging much easier and hopefully less frequent.
-	If we were to have another release, considering the growing size of our product, we would need to focus more on adding descriptive comments in our code and using meaningful variable names.


### Bad/harmful Practices:
-	We believe that during this release we resolved any harmful practice that we stumbled upon as we continued. Each sprint we followed the plans that we had for resolving our issues. We are proud to say that as a team we do not believe we had any major bad practices left as of sprint 3. 

### Best experience in sprint 3:
-	Similar to the past sprints, our team is extremely happy to see our hard work come to life as Wabi Sabi. We are happy that we were able to implement the features that we had in mind since sprint 0. Seeing our application come together has been the best experience for us in this release. 
-	We are also thrilled to see how all the features that we worked on each sprint, came together as one cohesive application. We believe that we were able to produce a high-quality application that allows users to easily track and see their progress. We can say that we were able to achieve our goal for this release.
-	We do all believe that we couldn’t have had such an amazing experience working on this project, if it weren’t for the hard work of our team members. We all appreciate each other, and we are lucky to have worked with a highly motivated team.


### Worst experience in sprint 3:

-	Although the amount of documentation in sprint 3 was less than previous sprints, we still did have to allocate a lot of time to documentation which was difficult considering our other courses. We understand that documentation is necessary, however we are not extremely fond of it.

### How do we think the release went:
Let’s go over the comments from team members.

**Amanuel:** Everything went well. All of us communicated throughout the project and helped each other, which made the project great.

**Jayden:** Very Happy with how the project turned out, good job team 

**Fred:** The release went amazing! We managed to finish it on time and met most of our initial goals from sprint0. Couldn't have done it with a better team

**Jarod:** Great! We're on time. I’m really happy with the project and am glad to have worked with this group. 

**Kimia:** I believe this project was the best group project experience I had ever had as the team was extremely nice, helpful and hard working. I feel very lucky to have worked with such a great team and I am so proud of where our app is standing at this moment as we were able to achieve the goals that we had for this release, and we even added some more small features. I believe our app is a very helpful tool and our team did a great job implementing the features.



We are very proud of our team, and we can clearly see that we have made a lot of improvements and we have developed a functioning product that also has a good user interface.
