# Sprint 2 retrospective
**Date:** November 19th, 7pm

**Participants:**
Amanuel Aknaw, Jayden Brooks, Fred Hong, Jarod Lustre, Kimia Rajaeifar

All points mentioned in this document is based on discussions among the entire team. All members of the team contributed to the meeting and decision-making process.

## Meeting documentation:

### Good Practices that we should continue:
-	We are glad that we were able to maintain the same level of communication that we had in sprint 1, in sprint 2 as well. We were able to discuss any issues that we had as a team in chat or in meetings. We do hope to continue this in the last sprint as well.
- 	We also appreciate the effort that the team made in meeting consistently to allow us to point out any issues as early as possible. We had consistent meetings in sprint 1 and 2 and we hope we can continue to do so in sprint 3 as well.
-	Our team is still happy with the task organization through Trello as it allows us to be able to access what we are working on and get more information on it easily. We do plan on continuing this in the last sprint as well.
-	We also believe being able to track each other progress on Trello allows us to know where to find the work that each team member did as we ask the team to update the ticket with their PR link. Since this approach has been helpful in the past 2 sprints, we hope to continue this for the last sprint as well.
-	We continued using Swagger for our backend documentation and we also continued having md files for more detailed documentation. This way of documentation proved to be an accessible way of making the information available for our TAs and the other team members to access so we do plan to continue this moving forward as well.
-	In sprint 2 we wanted to separate routes by HTTP headers rather than just the URL and we are happy to inform that we were able to make this update. Our requests are cleaner now, so we hope to continue this practice moving forwards.


### New practices:
-	Last sprint we did mention that we want to submit our pull requests earlier. Although we made progress in doing so, we believe that we can still try to do this earlier so if one of the team members needs something from the portions that have already been worked on, they can use them as soon as possible. We are hoping to make sure we submit our PRs earlier next sprint.
-	Two of our team members believe that there might be a better way to handle our to do-list and they are hoping to look at it in sprint 3 given we have enough time.
-	One of our team members found some code repetition that can be simplified or removed. During sprint 3 while working on his tickets Amanuel has mentioned that he wants to look at that issue as well.
-	We also believe that besides the documentation that we add we need to make sure we add more comments in the code to allow for other team members to easily understand the features if they need to work on a feature that someone else previously worked on. We are hoping to do so moving forwards.
-	In the upcoming sprints we should test our code locally as thoroughly as possible by considering all the cases and at least trying out the basic functionalities before submitting a pull request.


### Bad/harmful Practices:
-	This sprint we had one major harmful practice as we had managed to avoid the harmful practices we had last sprint. In sprint 2 we did not put as much effort into testing which proved to cause multiple problems such as merge issues and the code not functioning as intended when another team member is testing the PR. This greatly increased our development time because instead of the developer testing the code, this weight fell on whoever was checking their PR which caused issues for our timeline because debugging these issues are much faster if the person who develops them finds them. We truly hope to avoid this in the upcoming sprint, and we hope that we can test the features locally before pushing to make sure they work as intended to help lower the pressure on other team members as well.

### Best experience in sprint2:
-	Each one of our team members is happy that they can try on new features each sprint. In our sprint planning we always make sure to allow the members to work on tickets that they want to learn about and are interested in doing. This has allowed our team to work on complex features without feeling pressured.
-	We can each see our abilities growing with each sprint and that is an amazing experience. We are thrilled to see our abilities and our Web app growing at the same time. As a team we are hoping to continue learning and working on more complex features as we continue.
-	As a team we all agree that seeing our app grow has been a rewarding experience. We are so happy that we have been able to continue adding new features to our app with the same rate that we did in sprint 1 and we hope to be able to do so in sprint 3 as well. We cannot wait to see our first release.
-	We feel that developing this app has gone very well because of the amazing team that we have. We can see that our members care about this project, and they are working very hard to make sure that our web app can reach its highest potential. We are sure that our team will continue giving their best for the upcoming sprint.
-	We are so happy to have worked on a project that is very useful to the student life. Wabi Sabi solves issues that we were facing as students. Even when we present our app to our friends, they all mention how such an app could have helped with their studies. This continues to motivate us to have an amazing first release.


### Worst experience in sprint 2:

-	Different from sprint 1 retrospective, this time the team unanimously mentioned fixing bugs. This sprint as we worked on adding more features and building on top of what we had, we continued facing more bugs than we did in sprint1. We did manage to solve them all as a team as everyone in the team is extremely helpful and we all try to support each other. We understand that we cannot avoid bugs, but we hope we can lessen the bugs by having more thorough local testing.
-	Although the amount of documentation in sprint 2 was less than sprint 1 since we had the building blocks ready from sprint 1, we still did have to allocate a lot of time to documentation which was difficult considering our other courses. We understand that documentation is necessary, and we continue to make time for it as we did in the previous sprints.

We are very proud of our team, and we can clearly see that we have made a lot of improvement since sprint 1.
