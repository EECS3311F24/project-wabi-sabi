  - `ChartContainer`, `ChartTooltip`, and `ChartConfig` for chart configuration and styling.
- **UI Components**:
  - `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription` for structuring the component layout.
- **TagDropdown**:
  - A dropdown component for filtering chart data by tag.
- **Authentication**:
  - `useAuth` hook to retrieve the `authToken` for authenticated API requests.

## State Variables

- **selectedTag**: Tracks the currently selected tag for filtering data. Defaults to an empty string (no filter).
- **chartData**: Stores the chart data fetched from the backend.

## Component Functionality

### Fetching Data

- **`fetchWeeklyData`**: Fetches weekly focus time data from the backend API. If a tag is selected, the tag ID is included in the request to filter the data. The data is formatted for display in the bar chart:
  - **Day**: Maps the `weekday` index to its corresponding day of the week.
  - **Hours**: Converts minutes to hours and formats the value.

### Handling Tag Selection

- **`handleTagChange`**: Updates the `selectedTag` state when a tag is selected from the dropdown, triggering a data fetch.

### Chart Configuration

- Displays:
  - **Days of the Week** on the x-axis, abbreviated to three letters.
  - **Focus Hours** on the y-axis, labeled with a rotated text label.
  - Data bars are styled with rounded corners and a custom color defined in `chartConfig`.

### Effects

- **`useEffect`**: Monitors changes to the `selectedTag` state and fetches updated data whenever the tag changes.

## Component Structure

- **Card**: Wraps the entire component for consistent styling.
  - **CardHeader**:
    - **CardTitle**: Displays the title "Focus Time Bar Chart."
    - **CardDescription**: Displays the subtitle "Last Week."
    - **TagDropdown**: Allows users to filter data by selecting a tag.
  - **CardContent**:
    - **ChartContainer**: Wraps the chart for additional configuration and styling.
    - **BarChart**: Displays the focus hours for each day of the week.

## Usage

Include the `FocusTime` component in a dashboard or analytics page where users can view their focus hours and filter data by tags.

# TaskCompletionChart Component Documentation

## Overview

The `TaskCompletionChart` component visualizes task completion percentages by tag in a vertical bar chart. It fetches data from a backend API, processes it, and dynamically generates the chart configuration to display task completion percentages.

## Dependencies

This component relies on:

- **State Management**:
  - `useState` and `useEffect` from React for managing state and fetching data on component mount.
- **Chart Components**:
  - `BarChart`, `Bar`, `XAxis`, `YAxis` from `recharts` for rendering the bar chart.
  - `ChartContainer`, `ChartTooltip`, and `ChartTooltipContent` for chart configuration and styling.
- **UI Components**:
  - `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `CardTitle` for structuring and styling the chart layout.
- **Authentication**:
  - `useAuth` hook to retrieve the `authToken` for authenticated API requests.

## Interfaces

### TaskCompletionData

Defines the structure of data returned by the API:

- **tag_text**: `string` - The name of the tag associated with the task.
- **percentage**: `number` - The percentage of tasks completed for the tag.

## State Variables

- **chartData**: Stores the processed data for the chart, initialized as an array of objects with `tag` and `percent` properties.
- **chartConfig**: Dynamically generates configuration for the chart, including label formatting and color, based on the tags in `chartData`.

## Component Functionality

### Fetching Data

- **`getTaskCompletionChart`**: Fetches task completion data from the backend API using the `authToken` for authentication.
- **`fetchData`**: Processes the fetched data to format it for the chart:
  - **tag**: Tag name from the API response.
  - **percent**: Task completion percentage.
  - **fill**: Color used for the bar in the chart.

### Chart Configuration

- Dynamically generates `chartConfig` based on the `tag` values in `chartData`, assigning labels and colors for each bar.

### Effects

- **`useEffect`**: Fetches and processes data on component mount.

## Component Structure

- **Card**: Serves as the container for the chart.
  - **CardHeader**:
    - **CardTitle**: Displays the title "Task Completion by Tag (%)."
  - **CardContent**:
    - **ChartContainer**: Wraps the `BarChart` and provides additional configuration and styling.
    - **BarChart**: Displays task completion percentages for each tag in a vertical layout.
      - **YAxis**: Displays tags on the y-axis, formatted using `chartConfig`.
      - **XAxis**: Displays percentages (0 to 100) on the x-axis.
      - **ChartTooltip**: Custom tooltip to show additional information when hovering over a bar.
      - **Bar**: Represents task completion percentages for each tag.

## Usage

Include the `TaskCompletionChart` component on a dashboard or analytics page to visualize task completion percentages.
