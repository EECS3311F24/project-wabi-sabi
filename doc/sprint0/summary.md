# Summary
## Objective:
Build a Pomodoro deep work app that enhances the user’s productivity by tracking their study or work sessions and incorporating a to-do list for task task management. The application focuses on providing insights on the user’s performance through analytics, encouraging greater study habits. Additionally, the app will have gamification aspects that promotes user engagement

## Key Users:

The target users of the app are students and workers (or professionals) who are seeking to build foundational work habits to maximise their productivity. These type of users will require several study tools to gain insights on their study or work patterns

## Key Scenarios:
1. John has a full course load this semester, and is worried that he won’t be able to achieve high grades due to his inconsistent study habits and work load. This user needs to be able to track their study sessions in order to find inconsistencies/flaws in his study patterns.

2. Mary has been assigned a relatively important project at her work, which will require many hours of work. She often finds herself mentally exhausted from working for too long, affecting her overall performance. This user needs a session timer that allows her to work in intervals, giving herself breaks in order to maximise her efficiency without feeling exhausted. 

3. Harry tends to procrastinate when it comes to school work due to the lack of motivation. He often finds himself most efficient when competing against his friends. This user needs an application that helps him stay engaged when studying, and be able to connect with his friends to see their study rankings, in order to stay motivated.

## Key Principles: 
### Efficiency through Minimalism:
The app focuses on maximizing productivity through a minimalistic design approach, removing unnecessary features and distractions to ensure the user’s attention remains on deep work. 

### Visualizing Progress through Data:
The app transforms user’s productivity data into intuitive graphs and analytics, allowing users to visualize their progress and optimize their workflow based on trends overtime

### Empowering User Workflows:
The app centralizes all productivity tools in one place, streamlining your workflow without constantly juggling multiple features. This design allows users to be more focused and organized.
