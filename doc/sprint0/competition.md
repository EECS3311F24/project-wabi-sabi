# Competition
## Existing products:
There are currently several Pomodoro timer apps for users such as:

[Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/)

[pomodorotimer online](https://pomodorotimer.online/ )

[tomato timers](https://www.tomatotimers.com/) 

[forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc/) 

[focus keeper](https://focuskeeper.co/) 

While these apps provide tools to use the Pomodoro technique effectively, they lack features that allow for granular task management. And some of the apps available on the market such as forest, do not have an accessible web version that allows for seamless use of the app across different devices.

Our web application combines these features to create a complete productivity assistant that offers granular task tracking and an accessible platform for any device type.

## How our product differs:

Many competitors such as pomofocus and pomodoro timer online focus primarily on providing pomodoro technique-based timers and very basic to do lists. In our app we provide the following features that are not provided by other products such as:

-	Creating to do list tasks that allow for subtasks to be added
-	Allowing to set due dates for individual tasks
-	Tracking task completion based on number of subtasks completed
-	Allowing to filter tasks based on several criteria
-	Viewing reports and charts based on completed tasks and timers

Our app is designed to be a one stop solution for productivity and planning needs. While we offer the main features included in the pomodoro apps, we offer an addition of task management to the existing products, which allows you to manage all sides of your tasks in one place.
## Users and scenarios our product is better for:
-	Our product is more useful for users that need detailed task tracking to manage the tasks that they need to complete on top of using pomodoro timers. Our product is designed for people who do not want to switch between multiple apps to manage their productivity.
-	Our product gives users that are interested in insights of their data, more information about their focus habits with our insight charts.

## Why do the competitors not focus on this:

Current Pomodoro timers often focus solely on the timer portion, and they fail to recognise the importance of the task that is being worked on while using the pomodoro technique. For our competitors to understand the importance of this feature, they need to understand the importance of having one central place to track everything because the whole point of the pomodoro timer is to help with focus but having to go to multiple places to just track your tasks and your progress will make it difficult to focus on tasks and it might cause you to forget about something that you need to do.

For the other products to include these features, they need to work on a proper design for a cohesive experience for users who use both the timer and the to do list, while making this experience accessible across different platforms.
