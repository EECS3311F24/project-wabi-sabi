# Process
Our team is building a productivity app called Wabi-Sabi, a pomodoro timer and task manager that will help you focus and accomplish your goals. 

## Team organization
Team Wabi-Sabi has 5 members, and each member was chosen because of their prior development experience. Amanuel Aknaw and Kimia Rajaeifar have had experience working on the frontend, Jayden Brooks is a backend developer, and Jarod Lustre and Fred Hong have full stack experience. Despite this, we have collectively agreed that our members will work on other parts of the stack that may be out of their comfort zone to speed up development.

While these roles are distinct, our members have other skills that help us in other aspects of development (product management, UI design, etc.) 

Kimia helps the team visualize and break down features and Fred designed the Hero UI for our web app which we will be using moving forward. We used Trello and Jira to track our tickets and Figma for the UI design.

## Decision making
Our team makes decisions during meetings and usually by vote. We don’t decide on anything individually as we believe that everyone has a say in this project, no matter how  small the decision. If there are conflicting opinions, then we discuss further until we reach a compromise or are able to vote on a decision.

## How we prioritized user stories
User stories were prioritized based on what we considered a “minimum viable product”, that is, what we could accomplish to make our product presentable to a user in the minimal time we’re given. 

Based on our vision, we knew that we wanted to make a pomodoro timer and task management app, so the highest priority user stories were the ones that were directly related to that. The criteria for prioritization could be broken down as follows:
* How relevant is this user story to our vision (1 - 5)?
* How feasible is this to do within the sprint/project timeline (1 - 5)?
* How useful is this user story to our users (1 - 5)?

Coming to a consensus on point estimate is pretty quick for our team — typically only one round of voting is sufficient.

## Meetings
Our team in the preparation to, and during sprint 0, met on average 2 times a week. Our agenda for the meetings vary, but the nature of our meetings could either be administrative or technical in nature. 

Administrative
* Planning features
* Discussing deadlines and course-relevant work
* Breaking down and assigning tasks
* Follow ups

Technical
* Designing web app
* Setting up development environment
* Bug fixes
* Doing tasks related to infrastructure or development workflow

Each meeting in the week is dedicated to each kind.

## Next phase
For the next phase, our team plans on ramping up development on the frontend and backend, starting with our pomodoro timer and task manager. Our team has been consistent so far in planning and meeting deliverables and we hope to continue this in the next phase.

We’ve done well in terms of consistency and starting on work needed for this project and everyone has been doing their tasks though administrative work could be better divided among our members, which we plan on improving next.
